# ci/tools/bump-actions.sh -- move every `uses: owner/repo@<sha> # <tag>` pin in
# .github/ to the newest release of the tag's MAJOR line, rewriting both the sha
# and the trailing tag comment.
#
#   ci/tools/bump-actions.sh [--dry-run]
#
# WHY A SHA AND A COMMENT, AND WHY BOTH MUST MOVE TOGETHER
#
# A tag is mutable: whoever owns the action can repoint v5 at any commit, so a
# tag-pinned workflow runs whatever they push. The 40-char sha is the actual
# supply-chain control. But a bare sha is unreadable, so the convention is
# `@<sha> # v5` -- and that makes the comment a second copy of the truth. If a
# bump moves one and not the other, the file says v5 while running v4's code,
# and every later reader (including this script) trusts the lie. So the two are
# always rewritten as a unit, or not at all.
#
# MAJOR-LINE ONLY, ON PURPOSE
#
# v5 -> v6 is a breaking change by semver, and an unattended PR that silently
# crosses it turns a green CI into a debugging session nobody scheduled. This
# resolves the newest release WITHIN the pinned major (v5 -> newest v5.x) and
# reports a waiting major bump as a note for a human to do deliberately.
#
# Requires: gh (authenticated), git. Network: api.github.com.
